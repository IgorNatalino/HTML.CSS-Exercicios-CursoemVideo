You can use "pre" to organize better the lines.
If you use it, the paragraph will be as written in the IDLE.
Just like this!

    <p>So, if you quoting someone you must use "q" to give a meaning to the text like <q>What if everything turns out better than you ever imagined?</q></p>
    <p>In some cases a quote can be longer than a phrase, when that happens the tag "blockquote" should be used. Here is an example:</p>
    <p>
        <blockquote cite=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/enemy_at_the_gates/quotes/ >I've been such a fool, Vassili. Man will always be a man. There is no new man. We tried so hard to create a society that was equal, where there'd be nothing to envy your neighbour. But there's always something to envy. A smile, a friendship, something you don't have and want to appropriate. In this world, even a Soviet one, there will always be rich and poor. Rich in gifts, poor in gifts. Rich in love, poor in love.</blockquote>
